The following file contains code for function which converts a number from one number system(base) to another. Upon giving the inputs which are the number, the current number system in which
number is being represented in (ex: binary, decimal, hexidecimal) and the number system which the user wants to convert it to we can get the output.
The file also contains the functions required to perform all the 4 arithmetic operation on two *BINARY NUMBERS*, both signed and unsigned, the user is required input the two numbers and 
number of bits , whether the representation is signed or unsigned and the operation they wish to perform on the two numbers. An overflow error occurs when the final result requires more bits 
than the input allows.
